# AccessControlBox
The code for the access control boxes.

## Status (9/14/2018)
The code can read a card number from the reader as a keyboard device without using stdinput.
If there is no input for 5 seconds, the device is locked.
The device will remain active as long as there is a card (if the reader is set to output continuously using the pcProx utility).
There is currently no connection to a database/webapp.
